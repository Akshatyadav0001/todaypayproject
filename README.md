Demo link

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Install Node.js and npm
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from Node.js.

2. Set Up the Project
Open VSCode and open a terminal (Ctrl + `).

Create a new Vite project:

npm create vite@latest my-project --template react
cd my-project

Install dependencies:

npm install
3. Create Your React Components

Edit the src folder to add your components and pages. Here is a basic structure:

src
components
Header.jsx
Footer.jsx
pages
Home.jsx
App.jsx
main.jsx
index.css

4. Run Your Application
Start the development server:


npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (default port for Vite).

5. Customize Your Application
Modify the CSS in index.css to style your application.
Add more components and routes as needed to match the functionality of the Today Pay app.
Additional Tips
Use React Router for navigation between different pages.
Use context or a state management library like Redux for managing state.
Deploy your app using Vercel or another hosting service when ready
